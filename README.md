### 1st Commit

- Load data to raw HTML dataframe for cleaning and analysis.

### 2nd Commit

- Data runs from 1986-07-09 to 2017-11-10

- I think I would like to analyse the data in sets of 5 year timespans

- 1990-1995, 1995-2000, 2000-2005, 2005-2010, 2010-2015

- I want to name the 5 separate tables in 5 routes, respectively as, /90, /95, /00, /05, /10

### 3rd Commit

- I want to take the "High" column data from all 5 datasets and show the yearly average for years 1-5. Year 1 on the X-axis would be 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010. Year 5 would be the aggregated points of 1994, 1999, 2004, 2009, 2014. I want this visualization to be a new route while keeping the prior code the same.
